## Introduction

A Mac OS like unarchiver tool for Linux. Ubuntu's default Archive Manager (file-roller) is slow and you need 3-4 clicks to get a file extracted. The Mac OS's unarchiver one is just one-click. Now with this small tool, your productivity is improved!

## Installation

Go to [Release Page](https://github.com/jasonleakey/1click-unarchiver-linux/releases), download and double-click to install the deb file.
