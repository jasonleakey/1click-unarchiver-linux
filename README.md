## Introduction

A Mac OS like unarchiver tool for Linux. Ubuntu's default Archive Manager (file-roller) is slow and you need 3-4 clicks to get a file extracted. The Mac OS's unarchiver one is just one-click. Now with this small tool, your productivity is improved!

## Installation

Download [the latest release](https://github.com/jasonleakey/1click-unarchiver-linux/releases/download/0.1/unarchiver-0.1.deb) and double-click to install the deb file. 

After you installed the package, right click any 'zip/tar' file and change the 'Open With' to **Unarchiver**.

It will automatically extract the file to the same folder and present it to you.
